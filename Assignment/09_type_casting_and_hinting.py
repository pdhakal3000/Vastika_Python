Type-casting and Hinting Exercises

Please read the note carefully and try to solve the problem below:

"""


"""
1. Type Hinting
    a. create a variable <odd> with hinting as `int` and assign a value to it.
    b. create a variable <PI> with hinting as `float` and assign 3.1415 to it.

    c. create any variable with `string` type hinting and assign `integer` value to it.
        - Check whether the program gives error in execution or not.
        - If it gives or does not give error, then why it gives or does not give error?
"""
#%% 1a create a variable <odd> with hinting as `int` and assign a value to it.

odd:int = 10
print(type(odd))

#%%Answer 1b create a variable <PI> with hinting as `float` and assign 3.1415 to it.

PI: float = 3.1415
print(type(PI))

#%% Answer 1c
string:str = 5 # integer 5 is hinted as str
print(string) # just printing output
print(type(string)) # Checking type of the variable string.

# Hinting in python programming is not forcefull to do whatever we hint rather 
# it goes with its own internal guidence and recognise the type of value and 
# process accordingly further. It does not give any error but prceeds as an integer.

2. Type Conversion
"""
# ----------------------------------------[ a ]-----------------------------------------------
#%%
PI = 3.1415
# I want to print the value of PI to be 3. How should I convert the data to an integer
PI_int = int(PI)# This is oe of the way to convert float to int.
print(PI_int)
# ----------------------------------------[ b ]-----------------------------------------------
#%%
str_1 = "20"
str_2 = "30"

print(str_1 + str_2)
# above line gives us output of "2030" but I want the answer to be 50.
# How would you solve the problem using type conversion?
print(f'Here is the answer after type conversion : {int(str_1) + int(str_2)} ')

#%%
# ----------------------------------------[ c ]-----------------------------------------------
x = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
sum = 0
"""
- I want the value of sum to be 15.
- The way I get 15 is by adding all items from the list `x`.

Hint: the addition may involve
- for loops in the list
- type conversion
"""
for i in x :
    sum += int(i)

print(f'{sum} is sum of the elements of the list x after type conversion.')

use type conversion to these lists to appropriate data type and find out

Suppose you went to a coffee shop. A shopkeeper asked you to create a program that serves coffee
according to the customer's requirements.
The coffee machine should ask user to enter any numbers below that should make a coffee and serve it to the user.
Please use the `make_coffee()` function below to prepare a coffee and serve it.
Followings are the ingredients for coffee:
Sugar: no. of spoons
beans: no. of spoons
milk: volume in ml.
The total volume of coffee should be 250ml. The maximum volume of milk can be only upto  150ml. greater than that
should give the error saying not acceptable.
Finally print the line describing the coffee you prepared along with  milk and water composition.
